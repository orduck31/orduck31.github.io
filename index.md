# Marshall Smith
I am currently a senior at United Tribes Technical College, pursuing an Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Science & Research. I am working in the InterTribal Research and Resource Cente with Dr. Emily Biggane.  We are working on how environmental toxicants cause cancer in the bladder.  Currently I am working on my senior research for my degree.  That research is using Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) to degrade plastics in soil.  I have completed interships with USDA-ARS, USDA- NRCS and current to date with Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab with Univesity of Colorado Boulder.
